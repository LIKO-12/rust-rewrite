## About

LIKO-12 is a programming environment that aims to help people learn how to program in JavaScript, while giving them a tour on how old computers and their limitations used to be.

## Project Status

The project is being rewritten in ðŸ¦€ Rust and using V8 âš™ for embedding JavaScript.

You can view the announcement on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rami_sab07/status/1434851235564228609?s=20) or on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/LIKO-12/Legacy/discussions/272).

## Project history

The original version of LIKO-12 was heavily inspired by [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and still available on (Windows, Linux, macOS and Android):

- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/LIKO-12/Legacy/releases)
- [Itch.io](https://ramilego4game.itch.io/liko12)
- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.ramilego4game.liko12)
- [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/liko-12)
- [Source-code](https://github.com/LIKO-12/Legacy)

It was completely written in Lua using the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org) framework, and used Lua to let you write games in.

The goal of the project was maybe much more different back then, now it's being built mainly for helping people learn programming.

And for the Documentation, it's in-complete and unfortunately scattered over multiple places:

- In the [Cheatsheets](https://liko-12.github.io/#/Documentation/Cheatsheets/) (best resource I believe).
- [LIKO-12 GitHub Webpage](https://liko-12.github.io/) (Sufferes from changing navigation bar issues).
- [Another GitHub Webpage](https://liko-12.github.io/WIP/) (an attempt to get better documentation).
- Via a Discord bot on [LIKO-12's Discord](https://discord.gg/GDtHrsJ)
- In a JSON format on the [API-Documentation Repository](https://github.com/LIKO-12/API-Documentation) (used by the Discord bot).
